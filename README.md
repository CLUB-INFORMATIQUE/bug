# The Scala bug issue tracker

## Before opening an issue

Before opening an issue to report a bug in the Scala compiler or standard library, please:
  1. do a quick search to make sure it's a new bug;
  2. use a small, self-contained snippet of Scala code to illustrate what happened, and contrast with what you expected the compiler to say or the library to do;
  3. include the Scala version(s) you've tried, and the version of the JVM you're using.

## About

The first 10250 issues in this tracker were [imported](https://github.com/adriaanm/bbj) from [JIRA](https://issues.scala-lang.org?orig=1).
We made every attempt to preserve all data and metadata that's supported by the GitHub import API. Sadly, the author metadata could not be preserved directly.
